We&#39;ve got X rounds of Bingo tonight, but there&#39;s no pressure to stay for all of them! The best thing about bingo is that you can come in and join at any time, or leave at any time! To play bingo all you need to do is make any qualifying purchase at the bar, which is any food or beverage. </p><p> As usual we have prizes up for grabs in each round! 1st prize in each round will receive 3 drink tickets, and second place will receive a single drink ticket. Limit is one win per table per round, so you cannot win both 1st and 2nd prize in the round. Drink tickets are redeemable at your next Rouseabout game night, either trivia or bingo! </p><p> Bingo is played in teams (sometimes), all you have to do is listen out for the songs on your sheet, and as you hear them, mark them off. Once you have the <i>--insert bingo pattern here eg: 5 down, 5 across, or 5 diagonal--</i> sing out bingo and come and see us at the bar to verify your win! </p><p>After both prizes have been claimed we move on to the next round.</p><p>Tonights menu on the food truck is <i>--read out menu here--</i></p><p> We have a few events coming up over the next week, <i>--read out events here--</i></p><p><b>END OF SCRIPT</b></p><ul><li>Print all of the following sheets.</li><li> Using the bingo site that skips the songs, you can also keep track of the songs played using the right hand menu </li></ul>",9),V={class:"subpage"},A=e("div",{class:"logo flex-items"},[e("img",{src:k,class:"logo-full"})],-1),C=e("div",{class:"flex-items title"},"MUSICAL BINGO",-1),P={key:0,class:"title"},I=p({__name:"BingoLayout",setup(g){const u=b([]),o=_;return m(()=>{for(let l=0;l<o.numberOfSheets;l++)u.value.push(l)}),(l,c)=>(t(),s(i,null,[e("div",T,[e("div",L,[N,e("p",null,[h(" Link to Playlist: "),e("a",{href:a(o).playlistURL},r(a(o).playlistURL),9,O)]),R])]),(t(!0),s(i,null,d(u.value,n=>(t(),s("div",{class:"page",key:n},[e("div",V,[e("header",null,[A,C,a(o).subtitle?(t(),s("div",P,r(a(o).subtitle),1)):v("",!0)]),f(S,{index:n},null,8,["index"]),e("footer",null,"Page "+r(n+1)+"/"+r(a(o).numberOfSheets),1)])]))),128))],64))}});export{I as default};
